# PocketChipCommunity

This repository is intended to be used to organise the project, and associated repositories.

## Project Goal

Provide optimised builds for Pocket Chip, a now discontinued device by the now defunct NextThingCo.

It would be fantastic to provide an updated userspace / kernel in the future.

## Communication and Participation

Please feel welcome to open a conversation via github issue.
